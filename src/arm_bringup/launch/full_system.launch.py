"""Launch the full SmartRobotArm system: arm description + Gazebo (verification) + ANIMA cognitive layer.

Note: v1 is a fixed tabletop manipulator. The Gazebo launch is kept for URDF verification
and ANIMA dry-runs only — real ML training is done on the real arm via LeRobot, not in sim.
Perception (W2) and manipulation (W3) packages are added later in the 8-week sprint.

## Overview

**SOMA Chess O1** is the first open-source version of the SOMA robotic arm series — a language-driven manipulation system built on the [ANIMA](https://github.com/jeffliulab/ANIMA_O1) cognitive framework. A user speaks a natural-language instruction; a Claude-based parser turns it into a structured task spec; open-vocabulary perception (Grounding DINO + SAM2) grounds the language to objects in the scene; an imitation-learning policy (ACT, trained on real teleop demos via LeRobot) executes skill primitives on a 4-DOF arm; and a vision-based validator verifies each step before reporting back.

**v1 goal**: pick and sort two physically distinct object classes — foam sponge cubes (forgiving, for basic grasping) and chess pieces (smaller, demanding precision) — demonstrating that a single cognitive layer can orchestrate different grip strategies for different objects.

**v2 goal (closed-source, future)**: actual chess playing — board state recognition, move planning via Stockfish + Claude, physical move execution, and a "universal board game" interface where describing any game's rules in natural language is enough to play it.

## Highlights

- **Language → real-robot action loop, end to end.** Speak `"put everything in the bin"` and the system finds all objects, plans the task, executes skill primitives on real hardware, validates success after each step — all on a single workstation.
- **Two object classes, one cognitive layer.** The same ANIMA pipeline handles foam sponge cubes and chess pieces without code changes — only the gripper width parameter differs. This demonstrates that the cognitive architecture generalizes across physically distinct objects.
- **Cognitive layer with verifiable reasoning.** Built on the open-source ANIMA framework: LLM-as-Parser (not LLM-as-Translator) emits structured TaskSpecs, a py_trees behavior tree executes them, and a test-and-check validator catches failures and triggers natural-language recovery.
- **Real-world imitation learning, not just simulation.** Teleop demos collected on the actual hardware via LeRobot, published as public LeRobotDataset on HuggingFace Hub, and trained into ACT (Action Chunking Transformer) policies with quantified per-skill success rates.
- **Open-vocabulary perception out of the box.** Grounding DINO + SAM2 turn arbitrary text queries (`"the green sponge"`, `"the chess piece"`, `"the empty bin"`) into world coordinates with no per-object training.
- **Fully open source.** Apache-2.0, public dataset, public code, public model weights — anyone with a Logitech C922 and a hobby arm can reproduce it.

The four-layer ANIMA architecture (NLU → Planning → Execution → Policy) is robot-agnostic. SOMA Chess O1 provides the skill registry, sensor configuration, and hardware driver; ANIMA handles everything from language understanding to skill dispatch. The same cognitive layer can be reused on other robot embodiments.

## What the Robot Can Do

### Skill Primitives

ACT-trained atomic skills, exposed as building blocks for the cognitive layer:

| Primitive | Description |
|---|---|
| `pick(x, y, object_class)` | Top-down grasp at the given world coordinate; gripper width selected by object class |
| `place(x, y)` | Release at the given world coordinate |
| `push(from, to)` | Non-prehensile push between two coordinates |

### Task Capabilities

The cognitive layer composes primitives into tasks of increasing complexity:

**Single-step language grounding**

- *"Put the green sponge in the bin."*
- *"Pick up the pawn."*

**Multi-step long-horizon tasks**

- *"Sort everything into the bin."*  ← v1 flagship: handles both sponges and chess pieces in one command
- *"Stack the three green sponges."*
- *"Clean up the table."*

**Conditional and spatial reasoning**

- *"If there's a sponge on the left, put it in the bin. Otherwise put the chess piece in."*
- *"Put the green sponge to the left of the yellow one."*
- *"Pick up the piece that doesn't belong."*

**Test-and-check with failure recovery**

- *"Put everything in the bin."*
- → picks sponge → validator confirms → picks chess piece → gripper slips
- → ANIMA verifies via vision: chess piece still at original position
- → retry
- → still fails
- → natural-language report: *"I tried twice and the gripper slipped on the chess piece. Want me to retry?"*

The test-and-check loop is a signature feature of ANIMA and is rare among LLM-on-robot demonstrations.

## About

**Author**: [Jeff Liu Lab](https://jeffliulab.com) — [@jeffliulab](https://github.com/jeffliulab).

**Reusable cognitive layer**. The [ANIMA framework](https://github.com/jeffliulab/ANIMA_O1) is developed as a separate open-source project so it can be reused on other robot embodiments — SOMA Chess O1 is the first reference implementation.

**v1 → v2 roadmap**. v1 (this repo, open-source) delivers language-driven pick-and-sort for sponges and chess pieces. v2 (closed-source, future) adds actual chess playing: board state recognition, Stockfish + Claude move planning, physical move execution, and a "universal board game" interface — describe any game's rules in natural language and the robot can play it.

**Long-term vision**. The goal is the SOMA home robot — a household robot that helps with chores and makes everyday life happier. SOMA Chess O1 is the manipulator capability layer; the fixed-station form factor here will eventually be integrated onto a mobile platform.
